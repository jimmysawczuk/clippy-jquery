## Welcome ##

**clippy-jquery** is a jQuery plugin designed to make the [clippy][1] SWF simple and easy to use.

## [Demo][5]

### Requirements ###

 * jQuery (tested on [1.7.2][2])
 * Flash (just the web browser plugin, no Flash *development* required).

### Getting started ###

1. Load jQuery and the plugin:

        <!-- use local jQuery if you prefer -->
        <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="jquery.clippy.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

2. Insert the clipboard text in the HTML, using a selector to keep track of which items you're using Clippy on:

        <b>URL:</b> http://jsaw.me/OFSS7V (<span class="clippy">http://jsaw.me/OFSS7V</span>)

3. In `$(document).ready()`, invoke the plugin:

        $(document).ready(function()
        {
            $('.clippy').clippy();
        });

4. Done!

### Options ###

#### Sending text ####
You can set the text that **clippy-jquery** uses using three different methods, in order of preference:

1. The `text` key in the `options` object passed to `clippy()`, i.e.: `$('#single_clippy').clippy({text: "This is a test"});`
2. The HTML5 `data` attribute `data-text` on the element(s) that you're referencing, i.e. `<span class="clippy" data-text="This is a test"></span>`
3. The inline text of the element(s) you're referencing.

#### Other options ####
Apart from `text`, here are some other options you can pass to `.clippy()`:

* `width` (default: `14`): The width in pixels of the generated SWF
* `height` (default: `14`): The height in pixels of the generated SWF
* `clippy_path` (default: `'clippy.swf'`): The path to `clippy.swf` that a client's web browser can use to access the file.
* `keep_text` (default: `false`): Whether or not to keep inline text inside clippy'ed elements
* `force_load` (default: `false`): If true, we'll try to load the SWF even if we can't detect flash in the user's browser
* `flashvars` (default: `{}`): extra Flash variables to pass to the SWF

#### Custom SWFObject attributes ####
It is also possible to pass some custom attributes to the SWFObject.

Here is an example to specify a class :

        $(document).ready(function()
        {
            $('.clippy').clippy(swfobject_attributes: { styleclass: 'clippy' });
        });
        
[SWFObject documentation][9] explains how to use these attributes.

### Caveats ###

* As with most jQuery plugins, if the element is dynamically created you need to make sure jQuery knows about it before you call `.clippy()`, i.e. invoke `.clippy()` after you append/prepend/insert the newly-created element into the DOM.
