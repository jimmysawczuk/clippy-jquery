## Welcome ##

**clippy-jquery** is a jQuery plugin designed to make the [clippy][1] SWF simple and easy to use.

### Requirements ###

 * jQuery (tested on [1.6.2][2])
 * Flash (just the web browser plugin, no Flash *development* required).

### Getting started ###

**In your `<head>`, you need to include jQuery and the plugin:**
	
	<!-- use local jQuery if you prefer -->
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	<script src="jquery.clippy.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	
**Insert the clipboard text in the HTML, using a selector to keep track of which items you're using Clippy on:**

	<b>URL:</b> http://www.domain.com/this/is/a/really/long/path/to/a/page.html 
		(<span class="clippy">http://www.domain.com/this/is/a/really/long/path/to/a/page.html</span>)

**In `$(document).ready()`, invoke the plugin:**

	$(document).ready(function()
	{
		$('.clippy').clippy();
	});
	
**Done!** You can see **clippy-jquery** in action [here][5].
